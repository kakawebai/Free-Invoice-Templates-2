                    <h1>The Technology Behind Our Invoice Generator</h1>
                    <p>Our Free Invoice Generator is built with modern, reliable web technologies to provide you with a seamless and secure experience. We believe in transparency and want to share the core technologies that power our tool. This page offers a brief overview of the technical stack we use.</p>

                    <h2>Core Technologies</h2>
                    <p>Our platform is built on a foundation of standard web technologies, ensuring compatibility and accessibility across a wide range of devices and browsers.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> We use semantic HTML5 to structure the content of our web pages, ensuring that the invoice generator is accessible and search-engine friendly.</li>
                        <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> Our visual styling is handled by CSS3. We use it to create a clean, modern, and responsive design that looks great on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The theme-switching functionality (light/dark mode) is also powered by CSS variables.</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> As the engine of our application, JavaScript handles all the interactive elements. This includes calculating totals, adding new line items, validating input, and generating the invoice preview in real-time. We use modern JavaScript (ES6+) to ensure our code is efficient and maintainable.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>PDF Generation</h2>
                    <p>The ability to download a professional PDF is a core feature of our invoice generator. To achieve this, we use a powerful client-side JavaScript library for creating PDFs.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Client-Side Generation:</strong> The PDF is generated directly in your browser. This means your invoice data is never sent to our servers, ensuring your privacy and security. The generation process is fast and does not require an internet connection after the page has loaded.</li>
                        <li><strong>Font and Image Embedding:</strong> The library allows us to embed fonts and images (like your company logo) directly into the PDF, ensuring that it looks consistent everywhere it is viewed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Our Commitment to Simplicity and Privacy</h2>
                    <p>We have intentionally chosen a simple, client-side technology stack for our invoice generator. Hereâ€™s why:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Privacy-Focused:</strong> By processing all data in your browser, we ensure that your sensitive financial information remains private. We do not store or transmit your invoice data.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Backend Required:</strong> Our tool runs entirely in the browser, which means there is no need for a complex server infrastructure. This makes the tool lightweight, fast, and highly available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Open and Transparent:</strong> The technologies we use are open standards, and you can view the source code of our site directly in your browser. We believe in transparency and want you to be confident in the tool you are using.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We are proud of the technology that powers our Free Invoice Generator and are committed to maintaining a simple, secure, and user-friendly tool.
