  <li><strong>Follow Up on Payments:</strong> Use reminders or calendar alerts to prompt clients about due dates, helping to maintain steady cash flow and reduce delays.</li>
  <li><strong>Ensure Legal Compliance:</strong> Verify that your invoices include necessary elements like invoice numbers, dates, and tax information to meet local regulations and avoid penalties.</li>
  <li><strong>Gather Client Feedback:</strong> Periodically ask clients about their experience with your invoices to identify areas for improvement, such as design or clarity enhancements.</li>
