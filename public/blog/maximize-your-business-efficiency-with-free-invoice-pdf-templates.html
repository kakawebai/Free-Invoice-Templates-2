  <li><strong>Add Your Business Information:</strong> Insert your company name, address, contact details, and logo to personalize the invoice.</li>
  <li><strong>Fill in Client and Invoice Details:</strong> Enter the client's information, invoice number, date, and due date. Be precise to avoid confusion.</li>
  <li><strong>List Items or Services:</strong> Describe the products or services provided, along with quantities, rates, and totals. Use clear language to ensure transparency.</li>
