                    <h1>Creating Your First Invoice: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to the Free Invoice Generator! Creating a professional invoice is one of the most critical tasks for any business, and our tool makes it simple and fast. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first invoice from start to finish.</p>

                    <h2>Step 1: Fill in Your Company Information</h2>
                    <p>The first section of the invoice is for your company's details. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Company Name:</strong> The official name of your business.</li>
                        <li><strong>Company Address:</strong> Your business address.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Your phone number and email, so clients can easily reach you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Company Logo:</strong> Upload your logo to give your invoice a professional and branded look. For tips, see our guide on <a href="adding-company-logo-to-invoices.html">adding a company logo</a>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Step 2: Enter Your Client's Details</h2>
                    <p>Next, you'll need to provide information about the client you are billing. This ensures the invoice is directed to the right person or company and includes all necessary details for their records.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Client's Name:</strong> The name of the person or company you are invoicing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Client's Address:</strong> The billing address of your client.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Step 3: Add Invoice-Specific Information</h2>
                    <p>This section contains the unique details of the invoice itself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Invoice Number:</strong> A unique identifier for each invoice. Using a sequential numbering system (e.g., INV-001, INV-002) is a common practice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Invoice Date:</strong> The date the invoice is issued.</li>
                        <li><strong>Due Date:</strong> The date by which payment is expected.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Step 4: List the Items or Services</h2>
                    <p>Here, you will detail the products sold or services rendered. For each item, you should include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Description:</strong> A clear and concise description of the item or service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> The amount or number of hours.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rate:</strong> The price per item or hourly rate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Amount:</strong> The total for that line item (Quantity x Rate).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can add multiple items by clicking the "Add Item" button. For more information, see our guide on <a href="managing-multiple-items.html">managing multiple items</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Step 5: Calculate the Total</h2>
                    <p>The final section of the invoice summarizes the costs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Subtotal:</strong> The sum of all line item amounts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discount:</strong> Apply a discount if applicable, either as a percentage or a fixed amount.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tax:</strong> Add any required taxes. Our tool can calculate this for you based on the rate you provide. Learn more in our <a href="calculating-taxes-and-discounts.html">guide to taxes and discounts</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Total:</strong> The final amount due.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Step 6: Add Notes and Payment Instructions</h2>
                    <p>Use the "Notes" section to add any additional information, such as payment terms, instructions, or a simple thank-you message. This is a great place to clarify anything that isn't covered elsewhere on the invoice.</p>

                    <h2>Step 7: Download Your Invoice</h2>
                    <p>Once you have reviewed all the information and are satisfied that it is correct, click the <strong>"Download PDF"</strong> button. Your professional invoice is now ready to be sent to your client!</p>
