                    <h1>Troubleshooting PDF Download Problems</h1>
                    <p>Encountering issues when trying to download your invoice as a PDF can be frustrating. This guide provides solutions to common problems to help you get your PDF without a hitch. If you continue to experience issues, our support team is here to help.</p>

                    <h2>Common PDF Download Issues and Solutions</h2>

                    <h3>1. The PDF Doesn't Download When I Click the Button</h3>
                    <p>If nothing happens when you click the "Download PDF" button, it could be due to a few reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pop-up Blockers:</strong> Your browser's pop-up blocker might be preventing the download window from appearing. Check your browser settings to allow pop-ups from FreeOnlineInvoice.org.</li>
                        <li><strong>Browser Extensions:</strong> Some browser extensions, particularly ad blockers or security plugins, can interfere with downloads. Try disabling them temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outdated Browser:</strong> Ensure your browser is up to date. An outdated browser might not be compatible with the technology used to generate the PDF. For more information, see our <a href="browser-compatibility.html">Browser Compatibility</a> guide.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2. The Downloaded PDF is Blank or Corrupted</h3>
                    <p>If the downloaded PDF file is blank, looks distorted, or won't open, try the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clear Browser Cache:</strong> Your browser's cache might be storing a corrupted version of the file. Clear your cache and try downloading the invoice again.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check for Special Characters:</strong> Unusual characters in the invoice fields can sometimes cause rendering issues. Review your invoice for any special symbols or characters and remove them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Try a Different Browser:</strong> If the problem persists, try using a different web browser to see if the issue is specific to your current browser.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. The PDF Formatting Looks Incorrect</h3>
                    <p>If the layout, fonts, or images in the PDF do not match the preview, this could be a rendering issue. Here’s what you can do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reset the Invoice:</strong> Use the "Reset" button to clear the form and start over. This can sometimes resolve temporary glitches.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check Your Logo File:</strong> If your company logo is not appearing correctly, ensure it is in a standard format (like JPEG or PNG) and is not excessively large. For best results, use an image with a transparent background.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use the Print-to-PDF Feature:</strong> As an alternative, you can use your browser's built-in "Print" function and select "Save as PDF" as the destination. This often produces a reliable, high-quality PDF. For more details, see our guide on <a href="saving-and-printing-invoices.html">Saving and Printing Invoices</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
