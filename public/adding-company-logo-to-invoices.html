                    <h1>Adding Company Logo to Invoices</h1>
                    <p>Adding a company logo to your invoices is a great way to reinforce your brand and create a professional impression. Our Free Invoice Generator makes it easy to include your logo on every invoice you create. Follow the steps below to get started.</p>

                    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Your Logo</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Prepare Your Logo:</strong> Before you begin, make sure your logo is saved in a common image format such as PNG, JPG, or GIF. For the best results, use a high-resolution image with a transparent background.</li>
                        <li><strong>Locate the Logo Upload Section:</strong> On the invoice creation page, you will find a section labeled "Company Logo." This is where you will upload your image file.</li>
                        <li><strong>Upload Your Logo:</strong> Click the "Choose File" or "Upload Logo" button. This will open a file selection dialog. Navigate to the location where you saved your logo, select the file, and click "Open."</li>
                        <li><strong>Preview Your Invoice:</strong> Once your logo is uploaded, it will automatically appear in the invoice preview on the right side of the screen. You can see how it will look on the final document.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust as Needed:</strong> If your logo appears too large or does not fit well, you may need to resize the image using an image editor and re-upload it. We recommend a logo size of approximately 200x100 pixels for optimal placement.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Tips for a Professional-Looking Logo</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High Resolution:</strong> Always use a high-quality image to avoid a pixelated or blurry appearance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparent Background:</strong> A logo with a transparent background (like a PNG file) will blend seamlessly with your invoice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Appropriate Size:</strong> Ensure your logo is not too large, as it can distract from the invoice details. A subtle, professional placement is key.</li>
                    </ul>
