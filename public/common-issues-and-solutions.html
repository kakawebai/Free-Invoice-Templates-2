                    <h1>Common Issues and Solutions</h1>
                    <p>While our Free Invoice Generator is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, you may occasionally encounter an issue. This guide covers some of the most common problems users face and provides step-by-step solutions to help you resolve them quickly.</p>

                    <h2>1. PDF Download Not Working</h2>
                    <p>If you are having trouble downloading your invoice as a PDF, it could be due to a few reasons. First, check our guide on <a href="pdf-download-problems.html">PDF Download Problems</a> for specific troubleshooting steps. Common solutions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Disabling Pop-up Blockers:</strong> Your browser's pop-up blocker may be preventing the PDF from opening. Disable it for our site and try again.</li>
                        <li><strong>Clearing Browser Cache:</strong> A corrupted cache can sometimes interfere with file downloads. Clear your browser's cache and cookies, then restart the browser.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trying a Different Browser:</strong> If the issue persists, try using a different browser to see if the problem is browser-specific. Refer to our <a href="browser-compatibility.html">Browser Compatibility</a> guide for a list of supported browsers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. Company Logo Not Displaying Correctly</h2>
                    <p>If your company logo is not appearing on the invoice or looks distorted, the issue is likely related to the file format or size. Please see our article on <a href="adding-company-logo-to-invoices.html">Adding a Company Logo</a> for detailed instructions. Key tips include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use a Supported File Format:</strong> We recommend using common image formats like JPEG, PNG, or GIF for the best results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check the Image Size:</strong> Very large images may fail to load properly. Try resizing your logo to a smaller dimension (e.g., 200x100 pixels) before uploading.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ensure High Resolution:</strong> For a crisp and professional look, use a high-resolution image.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Incorrect Calculations for Taxes or Discounts</h2>
                    <p>Our tool is designed to handle calculations automatically, but incorrect inputs can lead to errors. If your totals seem wrong, review the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Verify Tax and Discount Rates:</strong> Double-check that you have entered the correct percentages for taxes and discounts. For a detailed explanation, read our guide on <a href="calculating-taxes-and-discounts.html">Calculating Taxes and Discounts</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check for Typos:</strong> Ensure that all item prices and quantities are entered correctly. A simple typo can throw off the entire calculation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Trouble Saving or Printing Invoices</h2>
                    <p>If you are unable to save or print your invoice, the problem may be related to your browser or system settings. Our guide on <a href="saving-and-printing-invoices.html">Saving and Printing Invoices</a> offers several solutions, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Using the Print-to-PDF Feature:</strong> Most modern browsers have a built-in "Print to PDF" option that allows you to save a digital copy of your invoice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Checking Printer Connections:</strong> If printing directly, ensure your printer is properly connected and configured.</li>
                    </ul>
