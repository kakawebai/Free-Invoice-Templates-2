                    <h1>Customizing Your Invoice Templates</h1>
                    <p>A well-designed invoice reflects your brand's professionalism and attention to detail. While our Free Invoice Generator provides a clean and modern template by default, you have several options to customize it to better suit your brand identity. This guide will show you how to make your invoices uniquely yours.</p>

                    <h2>1. Adding Your Company Logo</h2>
                    <p>The most important customization you can make is adding your company logo. A logo instantly identifies your business and adds a layer of professionalism to your invoices. The process is simple:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Locate the <strong>"Company Logo"</strong> field in the top-left section of the generator.</li>
                        <li>Click the <strong>"Choose File"</strong> button to open your file browser.</li>
                        <li>Select your logo file. We recommend using a high-resolution image in JPEG, PNG, or GIF format.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>For more detailed instructions and tips on getting the best results, please read our guide on <a href="adding-company-logo-to-invoices.html">Adding Company Logo to Invoices</a>.</p>

                    <h2>2. Choosing Your Brand Colors</h2>
                    <p>While our current version uses a default color scheme, we are working on introducing new templates and color options. In the meantime, you can explore different looks by switching between the light and dark themes. The theme switcher is located in the top-right corner of the page.</p>

                    <h2>3. Customizing Invoice Fields</h2>
                    <p>Our invoice generator allows you to tailor the information included in your invoice to fit your needs. You can customize the following fields:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Invoice Number:</strong> Create a unique numbering system that works for your business.</li>
                        <li><strong>Notes Section:</strong> Use this space to add personalized messages, payment terms, or any other information relevant to the invoice. This is a great way to communicate directly with your client.</li>
                        <li><strong>Line Items:</strong> Clearly describe each product or service, and adjust the quantity and rate as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For a complete overview of all the fields and how to use them, refer to our guide on <a href="understanding-invoice-fields.html">Understanding Invoice Fields</a>.</p>

                    <h2>4. Exploring Different Invoice Templates</h2>
                    <p>We are continuously working on adding more invoice templates to give you a wider range of styles to choose from. Keep an eye on our <a href="invoice-templates.html">Invoice Templates</a> page for new additions and updates. You'll soon be able to select from various layouts to find the one that best represents your brand.</p>
